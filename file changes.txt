Auxiliary file changes for 0.31.14:
	data/index

	raws
		new mineral tag for slade -- [UNDIGGABLE] until digging accounts for things properly
		changed material properties for raw adamantine

	New world gen parameters
		[SITE_CAP:<number>]
			Limits overall number of sites to this.
			Caves and ruins are included in this number, so world gen civ spread stops cold once it is attained the way things currently go.

		[MEGABEAST_CAP:<number>]
			Attempts to place this many megabeast groups (also effectively capped by total cave number).
			In vanilla DF, there are no megabeasts that actually occur in groups, but it is possible in mods.
			Placing more beasts than caves will cause all caves to be filled by megabeasts.  This will leave nothing for races like kobolds.
			Can be zero if you don't want any megabeasts.

		[SEMIMEGABEAST_CAP:<number>]
			Attempts to place this many semimegabeast groups (they get the last cave remnants).
			Because they get the last available caves, setting this to maximum causes all remaining caves to be filled with civs unaffected.
			Can be zero if you don't want any semimegabeasts.

Temperature in the raws:

The temperature scale has freezing of water at 10000, and moves roughly at a fahrenheit scale.  Water boils at 10180, for example.
This means that temperatures can go well below absolute zero, but fantasy runs that way.
Water has spec heat 4.181 J/gC, and this is stored as 4181 in the raws.
Spec heat changes with change of state are not currently supported.
