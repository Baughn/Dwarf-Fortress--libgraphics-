See file_changes.txt for new init/interface information.
See command_line.txt for information on world generation from command lines.


TO BACK UP SAVES:

(1) Copy the relevant region folder in "data/save" to a safe location.
(2) When you want to reuse it, copy that region back to "data/save".  Do *NOT* overwrite an old folder, as it might leave residual files.

Please *DO* back up saves.  Although the game has permanent death and you might want to play it in that spirit, the game
is also an alpha, and your world might become corrupted by an error.  You can also make use of the auto save features settable in "data/init/init.txt".



TO USE OLD SAVES WHEN UPDATING VERSIONS:

(0) ***Note that this version of DF is only compatible with saves from 0.34.02+.***
(1) Unzip the new dwarves into a *NEW* folder.
(2) Copy "data/save" from the old folder into the new folder, or copy over the relevant region folders you've saved to "data/save".  Keep a backup in case something is wrong with the new version.
(3) When you start, your world should be accessible and ready to play.

Unzipping the new dwarves into your old folder will work most of the time, but if files have changed, it can crash, or worse yet, destroy your saves.



TO CHANGE DISPLAY AND SOUND OPTIONS:

Go to "data/init/init.txt".  These options will take effect the next time you start the game.



IF YOUR KEYBOARD ISN'T WORKING:

If you can get to the ESC keybindings menu (from the start screen, press ESC and then 2/8 to scroll to Key Bindings), you can set your key bindings.  If your "?" key on your keyboard doesn't work for help, you can set the keybinding properly here.  It might not display as a "*".  You can set the display up properly in "data/init/interface.txt" using the display strings at the top of the file.

Release notes for 0.34.05 (March 6, 2012):

The necromancer crash was coming up so often in crash reports that I figured now was a good time for another release.  Here it is!  Note that any old vanilla saves you move over will have a short error log on load for their broken eyelid raws.  This isn't a big deal, and you can either update the body detail plan file or just leave it.  New saves won't have this problem.

Major bug fixes
	(*) fixed crash from necromancers in dwarf mode
	(*) fixed crash from seed traders that only have access to wool bags
	(*) stopped adv mode sleeping from sticking you on rooftops and teleporting you outside of castles (underground case not done yet)
	(*) removed many effects and secret identity from ghosts (vampirism/lycanthropy/necromancer status etc.)

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*) traded adv mode items will go to backpack/quiver first depending on type
	(*) dwarves won't get unhappy thoughts from dead/rotting relatives if their deaths are not known
	(*) made various animals non-threatening (new saves only -- BENIGN tag can be added to old save raws, see file_changes.txt)
	(*) stopped untowered necromancers from losing their zombie pops in their camps
	(*) fixed broken names for bones and other butcher products
	(*) removed items from abandoned houses/shops
	(*) allowed adv mode abilities/powers to page through targets
	(*) vampires no longer blame children/babies
	(*) fixed broken companion paging/viewing for large numbers of companions
	(*) stopped undead cats from adopting dwarves
	(*) messed with crabs/horseshoe crab water behavior
	(*) disallowed animation of bogeymen (new saves only)
	(*) changed mule/muskox color
	(*) fixed a few animal descriptions
	(*) eyes/eyelids were broken in various ways
	(*) tweaked appearance of nearly empty sleep bar

Release notes for 0.34.04 (February 29, 2012):

There was a world gen crash if you exported an image after it was done running the history and then tried to offload the world.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.34.03 (February 28, 2012):

Here is the second set of fixes for the major release.  There are still enough problems with the new stuff to warrant continued work there before I move on to older issues, and the next release will probably be within the timeframe of the last two.

	(*) Added a tab for other stones in stone list and made stones with a reaction product class list as economic in stone list

	(*) Controlled snatcher number in world gen
	(*) Decreased questing rate in world gen
	(*) Stopped reraised corpses from bleeding to death

	(*) A few other minor tweaks listed in file_changes.txt
	(*) SDL version: Highlighting on unit screen fixed for TrueType (Baughn)

Release notes for 0.34.02 (February 18, 2012):

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.20/21 (March 6, 2011):

This is the first bug fix release for 0.31.19, where I've focused on new bugs.  The fixes are listed below.  It also includes a few sponsored critters (pandas and capybaras), as well as some of their wilder relatives.  Pandas are restricted to bamboo grazing and capybaras can vocalize in adv mode (bark, whistle, etc).  I added a mineral availability parameter that you can set from Create World Now or from the detailed parameter screen.  There are a few more things I can do there, but any extensive rewrite is going to have to wait for 3D veins and mine maps (Release 2 in the schedule).  Barring any catastrophes, we'll be moving on to the old-bug-fixing now.

Major bug fixes

	(*) Stopped "grass" from appearing in some underground areas

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.19 (February 16, 2011):

This is the first release of what we once called the Caravan Arc, where we'll be changing how trade and the economy work.  The entire release schedule is up at http://bay12games.com/dwarves/dev.html.  This particular release doesn't have visible changes to trade -- just a lot of world generation infrastructure.  People eat and starve in world gen now, though it doesn't matter afterward.  Subsequent releases coming up will be making use of these changes during play, but don't expect too much there this time.  There have been many other changes.  Seeing most of them will require generating a new world.

There are lots of new domestic animals.  We also added giraffes, rhinos, honey bees and bumblebees.  Bees were the winner of the animal sponsorship drive and they had many associated jobs, so we didn't try to get into the other sponsored beasts, but we'll be adding those in with every release.

Animals can be placed in pen/pasture zones, and grazing animals will need to graze on grass (they can also eat underground fungus found in many open cave layers).  Pastures should be made large enough to provide ample grass and to prevent animals from being stacked on top of each other.  Animals crammed into one place for too long can become grumpy and violent, but the animals will stay in the pastures without much tending (a dwarf may occasionally run over to an animal if it wanders off the pasture border to walk around something).  There is no way to trade for hay or animal feed at this time, so don't expect grazing animals in new forts to survive on glaciers or the deepest deserts.  Many deserts have patches of grass (or succulents) now.

Sheep, llamas and alpacas (and trolls for goblins) can be sheared and the wool can be spun into yarn.  Chickens and other birds will lay eggs in nest boxes if you place the boxes in accessible areas.  You can mill rocknuts into paste and press the paste for oil (which goes into jugs).  Pressing occurs at the new screw press building.

You can make many of the more clayish soil types into earthenware ceramics now (and you can make fire clay into stoneware and kaolinite into porcelain).  If a fort embark location has clay above the aquifer (or any clay if there is no aquifer), it'll be displayed in the embark readout.  I didn't get very far into glazing, but you can ash glaze and tin glaze (with cassiterite).  Earthenware jugs need to be glazed to hold liquids.  Stoneware and porcelain jugs don't require glaze but can be glazed.  You can also make large pots out of various materials, and these act like barrels (they are associated to stockpiles in the same way, etc.).

Honey bees can be collected and kept in artificial hives (which you can make out of various materials).  You'll need one natural hive on your embark location to get started, but after that you can split the colony into new artificial hives.  The process is fairly automated.  You just need to place the hive buildings and a beekeeper will do the rest.  You can adjust a few settings on each hive to control which hives are held for splitting and which are collected.  You'll need to have jugs around to collect honeycombs (the royal jelly holds up the process otherwise), and you'll need another jug to collect the honey.  Wax cakes can only be made into crafts by a wax worker at this time.

The site finder records the best hit in each square now, and you can stop the finder at any time and browse the results.  The categories and readout have been changed up a bit.  Minerals have been redistributed on the world map, though this might not be satisfying as I was expecting to get a bit farther with dwarf mode trade.  Adjustments might have to be made there until trade is updated.  We'll see.

Animals and plants occur with more or less contiguous ranges now, respecting biome.  There are specific grasses.  The evil grasses are probably a little extreme and seizure-inducing.  I might throttle that back.

I'm starting the first one to two week bug fix cycle now, so there weren't a lot of bug fixes for this release, but creatures, items and vegetation don't pick up as many contaminants now.

There are new options in the graphical map export from legends mode, and I fixed a bug there with village maps getting cut off.

For a list of the new tags available for modding (container reagents in reactions, etc.) see file_changes.txt or the new stock reactions.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.18 (November 16, 2010):

This one fixes up several crashes and other problems.  Maybe most notably, the problem where you'd become a criminal in adventure mode just by going back to a store, the handedness issue with uniform assignments (it might take it a while to clear out problems in old saves, and I can only state this as confidently as the tests I performed), and SDL movie recording.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.17 (November 11, 2010):

If you want to try out the improvements to adventure mode, I'd recommend generating a new world with at least 100 years of history.  I tried out adventuring in a world from 0.31.03, and it technically worked, but there wasn't much to do.  The reason I recommend some history is just to let the beasts get settled a bit, though it's not strictly required.  We haven't gotten threats moving around and arising during actual play yet, so your worlds will inevitably run out of adventure opportunities as you exhaust them, and games tend to be fast-paced and brief overall once you get the hang of it.  This will change during the next few major releases.  There's an update to the "Your First Adventurer" manual section that might be worth glancing at even if you have played an adventurer before.  Don't be surprised if you die learning a few facts about the world.

Major bug fixes
	(*)fixed problem with baron not arriving due to stale merchant reports
	(*)stopped old jobs/projectiles from tying up items on reclaim

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*)changed ring/bracelet symbol to make way for adv mode tools

	(*)fixed some old problems where input wasn't registering properly on movement, etc.

	(*)added (harder) rolling away for dodgers on the ground

Release notes for 0.31.16 (October 4, 2010):

Hopefully this one doesn't have any weird new issues.  That bumpy lag should be gone now, and there are expanded refuse pile options.  You can also turn off having your dwarves track around blood (it starts off in the init).  I left it on in adventure mode, but you can turn it off there too if you want.

Major bug fixes
	(*)got rid of intermittent lag that popped up in 0.31.15

New stuff
	(*)added spatter init options (dwarf mode defaults to no walking spread of spatter)
	(*)allowed skull/bone/shell/tooth/horn settings from refuse pile

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.15 (October 3, 2010):

The purpose of this release is to restore the missing invasions, and I threw in some easy fixes on top of it, mostly to the raws.

Major bug fixes
	(*)made invasions come again

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*)lots of raw fixes (see "file changes.txt")
	(*)made reactions show the proper building
	(*)made LEAVES load the 'character' style tile properly
	(*)corrected labor name "soap maker" -> "soap making"
	(*)fixed typo in world gen rejection dialog for missing civ definitions
	(*)fixed spelling of chinchilla for forgotten beasts (new ones only)

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.14 (September 23, 2010):

The main issues here were to handle the new bugs from 0.31.13 which were gumming things up (broken migration, undiggable adamantine) and to address site sprawl concerns a bit.  To the latter end, there's a new world gen option to limit the total number of sites and I've added a few options to "Create World Now!" to make use of that.  It's not going to be truly satisfying until dwarven sprawl is better defined and there are more things to do with the sprawl in adventure mode and in dwarf mode wars, but overall I don't plan to decrease the amount of sprawl drastically on default settings once that is handled -- sprawl will likely increase again once memory problems are addressed, there are more things to do with it, and it shifts more dynamically over long periods of time (improved war, disease, famine, migrations, etc).  For now you can control sprawl with the site cap, with the civilization number, with the savagery, and with the history end year from the "Create World Now!" menu without much fuss (and the default setting is much lighter on sprawl than the default in 0.31.13).

Major bug fixes
	(*)fixed problems with immigrants having strange unit types and erroneous announcements about terrifying forts
	(*)allowed raw adamantine to be diggable now by adding a new tag to slade for the time being.  There is a side effect -- slade in old saves will be diggable.  Add [UNDIGGABLE] to slade in the save's raws in inorganic_stone_mineral.txt in your save to fix that.  If you choose to dig through the slade, please don't report any associated bugs.  The game likely won't be able to deal with it properly.

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*)fixed plant text in food preferences and stopped generated forgotten beasts etc. from being chosen

New stuff
	(*)added site cap option to world gen parameters
	(*)added beast cap options to world gen parameters
	(*)added a few options to "create world now"

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.13 (September 15, 2010):

The framework for villages and sprawl is in place, and there are now "entity populations" which are made up of thousands of critters for which less information is tracked.  As it stands, this amounts to, say, ten times the number of historical figures after world generation has been running for a while, though it can vary a lot.  These changes have left adventure mode gutted, so don't expect old adventure mode saves to retain much information or work all that well.  Old dwarf mode saves should be fine for continued dwarf fortresses.  In new worlds, you can wander around the new villages, but don't expect anything to be going on.  This is the launching pad for what should be the Funification of adventure mode in the next (non-fix) release, but like many launching pads, it is kind of dull and gray.

As for the merits of this release, there are the bug fixes in the lists below.  The game should also be a bit faster.  I'm on a new compiler in Windows, which led to a general speed increase, and I also optimized some code for improvements on all OSs.  It's not the end of the story there by a long shot, but it is progress, anyway.  World generation itself might be a bit slower overall, since there's a lot more going on site-wise.  This is going to change as we set up relationships between the leaders, one way or another, but I can make a medium island world in around 10 minutes without the memory going totally nuts, and I thought that state was fit for release.

There are some side effects to not having any stable relationships between world gen sites while cutting down on site destructions, like having a site get pillaged for the thousandth time and so on, which will iron themselves out later.  For now, it's a bit weird.  I also saw a battle with negative numbers of soldiers but couldn't reproduce the situation, so there are probably additional issues as well.

The SDL version has the first pass at the experimental TrueType font support that Baughn is working on.  It is off by default in init.txt and it only works in the 2D print mode.  There are lots of justification etc. problems -- you don't need to report those.  Getting those fixed up is part of the process.  It's difficult to read in the standard window size, so you might want to limit yourself to full-screen or a large window with large grid cells when you are trying it out.

Crash fixes
	(*)fixed some potential problems with aborting zone placement, though it's not guaranteed to solve the crash there

Major bug fixes
	(*)fixed problem causing dwarves to not sleep in any bed
	(*)fixed problem causing dwarves not to respect ownership in sleeping priorities
	(*)made cursor center on buildings properly when linking them up to a lever etc.
	(*)stopped other civilizations from bringing liaisons
	(*)stopped building destroyer diplomats/traders from destroying things
	(*)made units check the validity of targets more often (counters certain interrupt spam)

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*)fixed broken vial making jobs
	(*)make rock short swords use the proper material for the final product
	(*)made horn silver use the stone template
	(*)moved all native metals off of metal template
	(*)stopped season counter from resetting to spring after travel in adventure mode

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.12 (July 25, 2010):

Aside from the major bug fixes listed below, I made skill increases a little faster during training.  Part of the problem is with how classes work -- the teacher and student skills are important, and they can heavily amplify the effects, so the gains for people without those skills were small.  Now it'll be even more extreme that the base rate has increased, so we'll have to see how that plays out in forts that get good teachers.

If your old fort has a dead liaison, your replacement liaison will be named after one of the standard professions most likely, but they should still perform their job.  New worlds should have dead liaisons kicked out completely and get new liaisons.

Crash fixes
	(*)fixed military training crash
	(*)fixed a crash during dwarf creation in arena mode after dwarf mode game had been played
	(*)fullscreen/windowed mode switch crash fixed (Baughn)

Major bug fixes
	(*)fixed new liaison coming when previous liaison is unavailable for any reason
	(*)fixed problem which stopped the liaison from talking about making a barony

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*)adjusted skill rates up a bit on indiv training and demonstrations
	(*)made att/skill rate loader treat 0s like NONE instead of the fastest rate

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.11 (July 23, 2010):

Combat was the focus last time, and this time I moved over to equipment and training.  There are a number of bugs left to fix, but a lot of the largest problems should be cleaned up and training should be somewhat usable now.  I wanted to shift ammunition over to a default system where it doesn't get tied to particular squads/hunters (with the old way left as a default for people that want to control it more), since that remains one of the more annoying things, but I didn't have time to finish it up.  Just make sure you have some extra bolts sitting around, and 'm'-'f' should show you how your squads are doing ammo-wise.  Barracks should also probably default to a non-reserved/non-purposed system, though that's not as bad as ammunition reservation is.  In any case, I'll be moving on to the month-end project and entity populations, though I'll release again sooner if something comes up.

Crash fixes
	(*)stopped crash when individual squad members were selected in 's' and you go back to 's' after leaving
	(*)fixed crash moving from ammo assignment creation to material assignment
	(*)fixed reclaim crash
	(*)fixed text mode crash in SDL version (Baughn)

Major bug fixes

	(*)made inactive/ordered squads free up their old training activities more quickly
	(*)stopped off-time training from gumming up squad training barracks assignment
	(*)removed dead/crazy/etc. dwarves from squads
	(*)dropped injured dwarves out of their activities properly
	(*)stopped bleeding dwarves from thinking they need to jump on the ground and be dragged to the hospital
	(*)stopped miners/woodcutters coming out of the military from thinking they had a claim to old tools
	(*)made people doing off-time training stop if it becomes inappropriate (kicked out of squad, etc.)
	(*)made quota countdown respect reactions again

Other bug fixes/tweaks
	(*)stopped body-component-based artifacts from defaulting out to iron figurines
	(*)made skill rust display properly on 'v' and made temporary skill loss conditions not display on military screen
	(*)changed rust display for skills
	(*)restricted shell moods to dwarves with shell prefs
	(*)stopped metal goblet/flask construction jobs from shuffling metal of product
	(*)fixed up idle strings for non-soldiers vs. lingering squad activities
	(*)decreased effect of low self-discipline on individual training
	(*)sped up training organization
	(*)WINDOWEDX/Y values respected when moving to windowed mode from full screen (Baughn)
	(*)fixed problem with skill demonstration session timer
	(*)added timers for sparring and individual combat drills
	(*)adjusted sparring pulled shots for recent combat balancing
	(*)adjusted skill rates for all practice activities
	(*)put forest start biome on humans (for proactive forest clearing)
	(*)changed hauling encumbrance speed formula and made hauling build atts slowly
	(*)stopped picks from being available to indiv choice soldiers
	(*)required subtype match for armor even under "partial match"
	(*)made off-duty archery training occur for indiv choice ranged weapons (not just crossbow)
	(*)cleaned up various raw typos (see file_changes.txt)
	(*)fixed a bunch of the "you" announcements in dwarf mode
	(*)made counter to stop excessive party attendence work properly
	(*)made it set up default ammo profiles for ranged squads

(*)fixed problem where your units would not recognize the nice people arriving on business as their friends
(*)stopped problem where removing a worn object in adv mode could leave you with two copies
(*)stopped seg-fault at quit in linux if sound wasn't initialized (oliver)

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.09 (July 10, 2010):

Lots of combat changes this time.  Keep in mind that old saves use the old raws, so you'll want to copy over at least item_weapon.txt, item_ammo.txt and inorganic_metal.txt to get more of the positive effects.  The adventure mode stone-making ability won't be available in old saves but butchery will be.

Crash fixes
	(*)fixed potential crash with container reactions
	(*)stopped arena mode from caving in/locking up when you leave control mode

	(*)metal values changed in raws
	(*)fixed problems preventing some gut pop-outs from happening
	(*)fixed issue with extra dodge rolls causing shots to become less square
	(*)other combat tweaks
	(*)obliterated arsenal dwarf (position will still exist in old saves, but won't be used/needed)
	(*)extended distance at which hunters are willing to shoot
	(*)made hunters return kills under more circumstances
	(*)allowed miners/woodcutters to switch immediately to hunt labor without getting confused about crossbow
	(*)stopped targeting of benign, far away wilderness creatures after they see you, unless they are close
	(*)force-allowed targeting of kill targets in some cases where it wasn't permitting it
	(*)stopped indiv choice melee/ranged from picking out weapons of the opposite type instead of just preferring them
	(*)fixed problem with custom workshops blanking out at times (save compat iffy here, might have to rebuild shops)

There are probably some Baughn SDL version tweaks not listed below.

Crash fixes
	(*) SDL graphics mode should work now (Baughn)
	(*) creating squads in Linux shouldn't crash the game now
	(*) stopped melting items from eventually crashing the game

Major bug fixes

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.04 (May 16, 2010):

The main thing here is the new OpenGL code by Svein Ove Aas (Baughn).  Especially if you weren't running at maximum framerates even on the title screen, you should notice a great improvement.  There are some modes worth messing around with in data/init/init.txt -- try "2D" if the game does not work as well as it used to (or stick with the legacy version if truly necessary).

You can get at macros with:
	Ctrl+r = record
	Ctrl+p = play
	Ctrl+s = save
	Ctrl+l = load
There is a directory data/init/macros for them.

You can use PNGs for (translucent) tilesets, you can resize the window using the border, you can zoom using the mouse wheel (reset with F10, you can rebind this to keys if you like) and multiple keys can be bound to one command.

A lot of changes were necessary to get this running, so there are likely to be a variety of bugs.  The legacy version has also been reorganized to make releases easier, so there could be new bugs even there.

Aside from that, we have some general fixes:

Crash fixes
	(*) stopped site finder from eating up a ton of memory (crashing the game on large maps)

Major bug fixes
	(*) changed day/night temperature calculations (fixes fish availability and melting in the rain)
	(*) stopped suture and dressing jobs from being repeated over and over on healed wounds

Minor changes
	(*) made all vermin and smallish outdoor corpse items disappear over time (can be hit after a month for vermin, season for corpse chunks)
	(*) changed ranges for adv mode temperature text
	(*) made temperature of squares adjacent to lava slightly lower


******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.03 (April 12, 2010):

I handled some more crashes and the main pathing issue.  Undead aren't quite where they need to be yet (skeletons in particular still don't understand how the skull and spine should be holding them together), but they are more killable in this version.  Since they don't make sense in the first place, there's a sort of hitpoint system for them now that'll get them dead eventually if you don't break them apart, though punching a skeleton to death takes a long time in this system and maces are still a bit underpowered.  The undead HP will be revisited once the undead have more of a basis in the underlying reality.  I'll get to maces etc. sooner.

Crash fixes
	(*) fixed a zone deletion crash (only for zones with buildings in them)
	(*) fixed crash in military screen upon switching to item assignment view when no squads were present
	(*) fixed crash from copying a schedule cell with fewer orders to one with more
	(*) fixed crash from changing alert view while scrolling through a schedule cells orders

Major bug fixes
	(*) fixed pathing problem (root cause was map generation vs. liquids, would mess up ramps/channels and more)
	(*) stopped missing undead/melted/etc. tissues holding parts from being severed

New stuff
	(*) allowed undead in arena
	(*) allowed undead to be killed by accumulated impacts for the time being while they don't make sense
	(*) stopped people from trying to wrestle the undead at all

Minor changes
	(*) messed with corpse piece colors a bit
	(*) fixed "and" spacing in stripe/spot descriptions
	(*) fixed nervous mannerism typo
	(*) fixed some raw typos (see file_changes.txt)

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.02 (April 8, 2010):

Here's the first little update.  Things are still settling down after the release, but it looks like I'll be able to work with the new bug tracker and handle things there day by day.  There will be a few more of these small releases before I begin the SDL/Mac/Linux/40d# merge, since there are more crashes and huge problems, but I'm going to start some of the preparation for the merge as well.

Crash fixes
	(*) [GRAPHICS:YES] should no longer crash the arena or world generation
	(*) fixed training activity crash (from removal of barracks)
	(*) fixed crash from doing a large flow-style activity zone

Minor changes
	(*) made zone removal still work if flows are corrected (uses rectangles)
	(*) made material projectile breath happen intermittently properly
	(*) corrected gorlak color
	(*) made blind cave bears eyeless and gave them extravision
	(*) fixed broken eyelid relationships
	(*) fixed broken child names for goat/unicorn/cave swallow
	(*) swapped giant caste names
	(*) fixed giant cave spider bite (was blunt)
	(*) fixed alligator eye text
	(*) made soap bars instead of globs
	(*) fixed horn silver environment
	(*) added cookability/vermin eating to meat material templates
	(*) added cookability/vermin eating to plant leaf/seed materials

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.31.01 (April 1, 2010):

It has been a long journey, and it is ongoing.  This release has all of the new stuff we've been talking about for more than a year, but it is quite buggy.  I also still need to do the merge with the OpenGL/Mac/Linux stuff as I mentioned in the dev log.  We have a new bug tracker at http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/ which we are going to try out.  Expect it to be populated over the next few days with hundreds of issues.  All the same, the testers seemed to be able to enjoy themselves, so please try everything out and have fun!

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.28.181.40d (September 6, 2008):

I decided to release the current bug fixes since a few of them involve patching up submitted saves and I wanted to get those out before I'm forced to break save compatibility for the next version.  I'll still be able to look at all previously submitted saves (and any saves submitted against this version), but fixes won't apply to the saves themselves as the next release won't be able to load them.

Minor Changes
	(*) made sparring dwarves work on their selected weapon/unarmed skills rather than using their best skills

Bug Fixes:
	(*) stopped thrown tantrum items from causing dwarf to become site enemy
	(*) resolved shared item conflicts during map offloads
	(*) prevented units with shared items (eg stuckins/wrestles) from leaving the dwarf mode play area
	(*) got rid of world gen crash during succession after death of prolific long-standing position holders with inbred descendants
	(*) fixed crash from human siege campfires
	(*) stopped dwarves from taking their current hauled object off to bed when they schedule a rest due to injuries
	(*) stopped dwarves from choosing to sleep on top of traps
	(*) made adventure mode store transactions respect containment
	(*) made combat-produced chunks respect forbid orders
	(*) made cats able to carry vermin properly again
	(*) got rid of erroneous goblin siege announcement for elves
	(*) stopped custom profession names from obscuring recruitment announcements
	(*) made forbidden items count toward wealth properly
	(*) stopped fell moods from occurring if the fortress race does not drop a corpse

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.28.181.40c (August 21, 2008):

Coffee'd up and fixed a display thing.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.28.181.40b (August 21, 2008):

Another one.  The partial print for graphics has been changed to a default-no init option, so if you weren't having display trouble and had a better framerate, you should turn it on.  It's in data/init/init.txt and it's called "PARTIAL_PRINT".  It'll probably take a while to resolve issues for everyone else.

Minor Changes:
	(*) added an init option for partial screen refreshes (defaults to off)
	(*) added windowed/fullscreen grid sizes

Bug Fixes:
	(*) stopped designation cursor from leaving a trail when the minimap is updating
	(*) fixed reclaim crash from units holding multigrasp clothing
	(*) fixed lockup for glassmaker moods where the glassmaker doesn't like glass
	(*) handled some other potential multigrasp inventory indexing issues
	(*) fixed problem potentially capping caravan wagon number at 2
	(*) handled new forbid orders vs. butchery, severs and sever-drops
	(*) fixed problem with delay on up digging tasks
	(*) fixed problem causing single tile mountain civs from using feature plants
	(*) fixed wagon occupancy problem leaving behind flags that stopped construction
	(*) stopped reclaim from creating a second site at the spot
	(*) stopped dirt road construction at glacier/stone interface
	(*) fixed problem with map export and flashing job markers

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.28.181.40a (August 18, 2008):

Here's another one.  Hopefully I can transition to some new features next month, since I've been handling technical issues and problems for a while now.

Additions:
	(*) you can save your embark settings for later use
	(*) added note-taking ability for embark screen
	(*) added forbid-on-death orders for your corpses, other non-hunted corpses, your items and other items
	(*) added forbid order for fired projectiles
	(*) made dwarves prefer to combine items in existing bags/barrels/bins with init options to govern this behavior

Minor Changes:
	(*) made obsidian an economic stone
	(*) did some display optimizations

Bug fixes:
	(*) fixed problem causing site finder to miss areas of the map when hunting for hidden features and rivers
	(*) stopped new kitchen restrictions on contained items from causing no-ingredient food items

	(*) fixed problem with up/down windows in adv mode for larger grid sizes
	(*) changed how fireballs interact with the ground
	(*) patched up decorated ammo values a bit
	(*) made cageless traps display properly in all circumstances

	(*) made zombie/skels that die in cages have proper corpses

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.28.181.39f:

More fixes, a bit of work toward armies and caravans, and an expandable view.  If you want to try different grid dimensions, change the relevant entry [GRID:80:25] near the top of data/init/init.txt.  You'll also have to adjust your window size or full screen resolution to match if you don't want the new, larger grid to be squashed.  If you overshoot, it'll stretch them unless you turn black space on.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.28.181.39a:

Okay, here's the new version.  You can do various things with world generation, though not much has changed with the regular game.  If you go into the world generation advanced parameters and start designing/drawing your own world, please keep in mind that you'll probably end up getting infinite reject cycles -- you can turn on the reject log in data/init/init.txt to see what's going wrong.  Oftentimes you'll be violating biome restrictions (you can just go through any that you find and 'n'ullify them to solve this problem).  As usual, let me know if it crashes and how to make it crash if it does -- I suspect there are new problems of all sorts lurking within every part of the game, despite having fixed more than 100 bugs for this version.

Save compatibility is a little iffy this time around -- there have been extensive changes to the mid-level maps, so it might get confused about the biome of a particular tile...  and worse.  I haven't noticed anything in limited messing around with old saves, but there will very likely be problems.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.176.38c:

This release should stop the command line crash from non-standard worlds, and it also has a shot at stopping the site sprawl issue during repeated world generation.  A fix for Power PC Macs is still in progress.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.176.38b:

This is the first Mac release.  Barring some tragic mistake, this is also the last bug fix release before the continuation of the Army Arc.  Again, this release is made up mostly of small changes that people wanted and some bug fixes for the worst problems introduced during the last release.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.176.38a:

Various little things that people have wanted for a while this time, as well as many additional bug fixes.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.173.38a:

The first army arc release, complete with no armies.  It really is mostly foundational work, but you'll notice some small changes here and there, more if you play adventure mode.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33g:

A few more fixes, a few new init options and a new interface for bringing items to the trade depot.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33f:

Various fixes people have been waiting for.  Fixed the farm problem from 33e, goblin sieges, mud tracking, made the treeline less annoying, made the missing gemstones available, and lots of other stuff.  See the dev log for a complete list.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33e:

Continuing along with bug fixing.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33d:

Fixed a few of the serious problems (one of the trade crashes, resting injury loops, waterskin filling at wells forever).  See the dev log for other minor changes.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33c:

Continuing along with bug fixing.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33b:

Various crash and lag fixes again.  See the dev log for other minor changes.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.33a:

Various crash and lag fixes.  There are still lags and crashes, but many of the major offenders have been handled now.  There were also several minor fixes.  See the dev log for those.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.27.169.32a:

Well, it has been a while.  That means potential instability, so don't get too attached to your fortresses at this point.  I'll be doing subsequent releases more often now as I solve problems.  In any case, dwarf mode now has a z-axis and you can make fortresses that span several levels.  Fluids behave much more reasonably, and you can walk across the world in adventure mode in the local view without having to step off of an artificial edge.  And various other lots more stuff.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.23.125.23a:

The backbone of temperature is in now, but there's still a lot to do.  I'm not working on it for a while again.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.123.23a:

A bug fix release along with a test-change for the FPS toggling.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.121.23b:

Few more crash bug fixes and several minor changes.

If you are having speed trouble, you can go to init and turn off temperature and weather to see if that's the issue.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.121.23a:

Here are some fixes for crash problems.  I've also added metal bins and more information to the sites in the setup screen.  I fixed the FPS/black space problems with the BMP export options and a few other minor problems as well.

There are still potentially serious problems from the temperature and other recent additions.  I'm going to continue working on bugs for the time being.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.120.23b:

I'm partly through the temperature rewrite.  This release has a lot of bug potential.  You should back up your save folders if you are updating from an older version.

You can set fire to shrubs as an adventurer using the [g] command when you are standing near one.  This is not a permanent command.

The temperature behavior of flows has not been implemented yet.  Very hot/cold creatures do not change the air temperature yet either.  There are a number of features that are in progress regarding temperature.

The problem with dwarves being stuck outside during the stay-inside order should be fixed, as well as a number of other bugs.  You can now move the cursor quickly by using shift + direction.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.120.23a:

Lots of bugs fixed this time around.  I caught a lot of the stay-inside problems, but there are probably some new issues with random jobs now.  I'll fix these as I hear about them.  I'll also correct any additional stay-inside problems as I hear about them.  It should be easier now that more infrastructure is in place.

There's also some creature graphics stuff you can play with.  See "raw/graphics/graphics_example.txt" to mess around with it.  You'll also need to set [GRAPHICS:YES] in "init/init.txt".  I only drew a miner picture, and a blobby dwarf thing, so I don't recommend this unless you are going to draw/use some additional tiles.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.23c:

Quick fix for missing color definition problem.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.23b:

Quick fix for dyes and a crash bug with inventories in adventure mode.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.23a:

There were various cosmetic changes to the game, mainly the addition of dyes and more art images.  The selection of dyes is very limited at present, and only involves ground plants.  There is a new workshop for this in dwarf mode.  You can use blue mushrooms or import other dyes from human traders.  This will be expanded later.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22f:

This release is mainly to handle the issues with specific piles.  There are a few other bug fixes as well.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22e:

Fixed a save corrupting problem.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22d:

Quick patch for a crash bug from saving furniture piles.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22c:

Aside from fixing some crash bugs, the main change this time is the addition of specific pile types.  You can access these from [q] on existing piles or you can set them when you are placing piles by selecting "custom settings".  Piles now make claims on bins and barrels.  This is displayed as "Cedar Bin <#12>".  You can use the [q] view for a pile to set the maximum number of bins and barrels it uses.  For now, a pile will only take one extra empty bin/barrel until something is placed inside, then it will take another until it gets up to the maximum.  We'll add some other options later.  In the [p]ile menu, you can also designate a number of reserved bins and barrels that will be used by jobs such as distillation before any stockpile gets to claim them.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.110.22a:

I fixed a lot of bugs; see the dev list.

The main change for this version was the rewrite of the inventory system.  There will probably be several compat. issues, as well as various horrible bugs.  I've tested and fixed what I've found, but you'll find more.  **Back up your old saves before trying this version**  The old saves will work with this version, but you need to be careful with them.

Those that deserve fingers and toes have them in this version.  You'll also notice right/left gloves.  Creatures lose items now with severs, so you'll lose your left gauntlet if your left arm is removed, for instance.

Creatures are a bit silly about wear they put on rings and other trinkets.  Rings will probably pile up on the right thumb for instance, and earrings will pile up in the right ear.  Armor stands will also only store one glove and one boot for the time being.  This will be sorted out over time.

There aren't any temperature effects despite the residents wearing clothing depending on the average temperature.  This will also be handled later.

Finally, there aren't any gender links to clothing right now, so you might see male dwarves in "dresses" and "skirts".  Keep in mind that men all over the world wear clothing like this, and that's what is meant by these generic terms.  You can remove the items from the entity raw before you play if it makes you feel uncomfortable.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.22.107.21a:

There will be families and guards in new world towns, concluding the first third of the Bustling Town Arc.

There's a wait key in adventure mode now (period), as well as some helpful "are you sure?" prompts.

Various bug fixes -- including the clothing acquirement bug, the shield equipment bug and some ashery bugs.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.104.21c:

I fixed various bugs and implemented other minor changes.  See the changes list for those.  Nobles can still demand items involving small creature bones in old saves, but the preference is no longer generated in new dwarves.

New worlds will see a few cosmetic changes in adventure mode towns (it was not possible to include them in old saves).  It's probably not worth generating a new world for them (and I haven't put up new pregenerated worlds), but the new towns have some larger cookie-cutter buildings like apartment complexes, and everybody will sleep at night and eat three meals a day from a magic barrel in their room that refills at midnight.  Once the caravans and a notion of wealth are in, this can all be differentiated properly instead.  As we progress along the Bustling Town Arc, it'll eventually be worthwhile to regenerate if you play adventure mode, but it's not a big deal right now.  In old worlds, you might notice some things like merchants taking breaks to wander around or sleeping on the beds in the mead hall.  They are just trying their best to follow the new schedules without having a home to go to.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.104.21b:

There's a skeleton of a workshop profile now.  It is in progress and undocumented.  You can select workers to work at the shop either by name or by skill level.  The list is not ordered yet.  You can use the mouse on this screen.  It's also written up in a new way that is independent of the 80x25 window to facilitate some more flexibility later on.

Many small fixes (read the dev log).

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.104.21a:

This fixes a problem with the export feature, lets you play around with the mouse when doing designations and cleans up some of the problems with flows and channel-related spam.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.104.19c:

Some highlights include fixing the disappearing bone/shell problem and allowing engraved wall images to be toggled on and off.  The detailing jobs shouldn't shut off at random any more.

Some of the issues with cat butchery have been handled.

I did a little bit with consolidating announcments (x2, x3, etc.), but I'll need more time to do it properly.

Alt-tabbing in full screen might work a little better.  Seems to work here is all I can say.

Until I make the cleaners smarter, blood disappears at the beginning of every season now.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.104.19a:

Fixed several crash bugs and cleaned up some affected saves.  I also found out why named creatures were disappearing sometimes and fixed that, though saves in which the problem is currently active will still see some of it.

Chasming refuse is in, though there will probably be some irregularities of which you'll have the pleasure of informing me.

There were some other changes that might help with sheriff/injury tantrums.

Some of the tree designation clearance problems should be gone.

Trade agreements should work properly.

The thieves that enter the fortress are somewhat easier to detect now.

Depending on how you've bound your keys, you should have the odd hold-down behavior only when using a cursor or scrolling now.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.102.19a:

Fixed a couple more crashes and various other errors (see the change log).

Genders are mixed on starting animals now and horses should breed.  The unit screen will show some other designations beside "No Job" and there it will distinguish merchants and diplomats.  Water should flow into the cliff face now, at least from new channels.

You can give your units nicknames and profession names now.  Do this from the [vpz] profile using [y] to customize them.  In adventure mode, you do it from the [l]ook + [enter] status view (again [y] to customize).  The [y] command appears onscreen.

Some tantrum issues were fixed.  Placing artifact furniture was actually making them unhappier.  Fist fights and beatings still led to a minor version of the civil war bug.  These issues have been resolved.

The "Shift + R Menu" instead of "n" for the N key has been resolved, though you might need to clean up your old files a bit if you are important old ones.

You can toggle between windowed and fullscreen mode using F11 (or whatever key you bind) whenever you like now.  Let me know what problems come up with this.  I haven't handled direct minimization from fullscreen, but you can toggle and minimize from the windowed mode.  You can also get rid of the "fullscreen?" box that pops up the beginning in "data\init\init.txt" now.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.101.19d:

Resolved a unit scrambling issue from active saves in adventure mode.  You will no longer turn into the stray dog in town or a random goblin or warthog.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.101.19c:

Fixed a few more crash problems, but the main thing was to hopefully remove some of the strange mainly adventure mode instability introduced by the last version.  In case this sort of thing persists, please be careful to back up your saves before trying this one.  Worlds that were generated in or even played in the briefly-available 0.21.101.19b are likely to be twisted to pieces, especially if you played adventure mode.


******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.101.19b:

Many more crash fixes, including stopping some of those inflate errors.  Those saves are still corrupted though.

I've changed how some of the search routines work.  I tested it out on several saves, but you should keep a copy of yours safe before you try this one just in case, as usual.  If you get around to creating a new world, you'll notice a significant speed increase when the years march up.  Some of this also carries over to the main game.

Finally, aqueduct behavior has been partially repaired.  Building an aqueduct over your chasm should work, but aqueducts over water can randomly drown your fortress.  If you want to get lava over the river, try a stone bridge instead.  If you lava is in a channel next to the bridge, you might need to use a floodgate to get it over.  Bridges over water filled channels probably won't conduct lava properly.  I'll get around to fixing the rest of this in time, but there are still some crash bugs etc. that are higher priority.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.101.19a:

Several crash bugs should be fixed now.  Most saves will be recoverage, unless they have a load inflate error.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.100.19a:

See command_line.txt for information on world generation from command lines.

******************************************************

Release notes for 0.21.95.19c:

Old save farmplots might show "Ft 0/0" for the fertilizer amount.  It will update at the beginning of the season.
