who will never see [PRO_POS] precious heart-friends again
whose pointed ears now decorate my dining room table
whom was felled like a slender sapling
whom I sent back to the home-tree as fertilizer
whom was fed the carrion of [PRO_POS] beloved animals before death
whom I garotted with [PRO_POS] own flimsy bowstring
whose fragile bones shattered before the power of my contempt
who came down from the home-tree and was devoured
who should have stayed in the trees when the real elves came down to fight
