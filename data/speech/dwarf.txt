who was too short to live
who played with [PRO_POS] mini-forge long into adulthood
whose beard was sparse and patchy
who tunneled away from me like a frightened mole
who sucked plump helmets like a purring maggot
who futilely attacked my legs
whose hammer shattered on the anvil of my majesty
who forged [PRO_POS] own doom by challenging me
whose beard I wove into a funeral shroud
who was returned to the rock and muck from which it was spawned
whose tall tales of bravery were all the more embarrassing because of [PRO_POS] height
