whose cries for mercy went unheeded by my wrath
a mere child brought low for the pleasure of my slaves
whose scant meat was fed to my beasts
a whelp that strayed too far from [PRO_POS] mother
who was too weak to toil in my slave pits and earned swift death instead
whose insignificant name I struggle to recall
a spineless slug whom was crushed under my majesty
whom I buried alive under a mountain of hatred
who lies dead, now only an embarrassing memory
who never learned who [PRO_POS] real father was
who sought my praise, only to be rejected in death
once revered by those who didn't know any better
who regrets [PRO_SUB] was ever spat out of [PRO_POS] mother's womb
