whose cries for mercy went unheeded by my wrath
whose insignificant name I struggle to recall
a spineless slug whom was crushed under my might
whom I buried alive under a mountain of hatred
who lies dead, now only an embarrassing memory
who sought my praise, only to be rejected in death
once revered by those who didn't know any better
