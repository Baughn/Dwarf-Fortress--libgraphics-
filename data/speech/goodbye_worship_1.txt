upon arising in the mornings,
when going on a long journey,
before retiring in the evening,
as sure as I am here now,
and lo,
it cannot be said enough;
these are dangerous times, so
I say again
yes,
before every meal,
whenever the tide turns,
when you return to this place,
when you arrive at your destination,
at this juncture in your life,
