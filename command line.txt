Dwarf Fortress Command Line Options


Dwarf Fortress currently offers one command line option, a world generator, suggested by genmac.  You can use it as follows:

FORMAT:	dwarfort.exe -gen <id number> <seed> <world gen param title>
EXAMPLE:	dwarfort.exe -gen 1 3498 STANDARD
EXAMPLE:	dwarfort.exe -gen 2 RANDOM CUSTOM6

This will open a silent, introless dwarf fortress, generate a world with the given id number and seed, export the region files and a picture, and finally quit.  The window remains open so you can see what's going on.  You can still abort world generation while it is running.  If you attempt to create a world number that already exists, it will abort immediately.
