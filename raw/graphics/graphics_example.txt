You can also use the entity/site link tokens in place of the profession tokens:

<position token from entity raws, for example, MONARCH>
FORCED_ADMINISTRATOR

PRIEST
SHOPKEEPER
SLAVE
PRISONER

In the absence of one of these, it will use their standard creature/profession tile, but you should include all seven of these for a given creature if you want multiple appointments to display properly.  The picture multiple appointments is selected in the order given above, but if a tile doesn't exist for the first appointment, it will jump down to the regular profession tile.
