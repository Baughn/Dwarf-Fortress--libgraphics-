# this is a DF launcher (64bit), replacing the one that ships with DF.
# it's purpose is to launch DF through musl's libc.so, because the DF
# binary has GLIBC's dynlinker hardcoded as interpreter.
# additionally it launches DF through launch-without-heap-randomization.elf.
# it turned out that the way musl's malloc work, DF will crash pretty rapidly
# if heap randomization is enabled (linux default).
# launch-without-heap-randomization.elf will turn that off.
# you can compile it from launch-without-heap-randomization.c:
# gcc launch-without-heap-randomization.c -o launch-without-heap-randomization.elf
# additionally we need compat.so, compiled from musl-glibc-compat-preload.c.
# see the comments in that file for build instructions.
# this wrapper and the 2 helpers go into the main DF directory, not into libs/.
