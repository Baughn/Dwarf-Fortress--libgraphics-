-------------------
System Requirements
-------------------

In addition to the hardware requirements (which will be the same as the other
platforms) your system will need these libraries installed:

* SDL 1.2+
* SDL_image

optional
* GTK+ 2+

And (optional) some kind of OpenGL implementation, so:

* libgl
* libglu

you need "scons" to build the source.

-------------------
Compiling
-------------------
it's not possible to compile the source with g++ 4.7.x due to
libstdc++ version incompatibilities with the one used by the
DF binary.

tested and known to work is g++ 4.4 and g++ 4.5
on debian and ubuntu, you can install it via 
apt-get install g++-4.4

to compile the source, use: 
CXX=g++-4.4 CXXFLAGS="-O3 fomit-frame-pointer" LDFLAGS=-s \
  scons [disable-gtk=1 disable-curses=1 disable-gl=1 disable-debug=1]

the options inside [] , as well as the environment variables
CXX, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS are optional.

if neither gtk nor curses are enabled, messageboxes displaying
information or asking questions such as "should the game run
fullscreen" ? are asked on the terminal window you started
df from, so be sure to keep an eye on it the first time
you start it.

-------------------
Commandline Options
-------------------

-sound_output : sets the sound system to use. Possible values:
    ALSA - Use the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture. (default)
    OSS  - Use the Open Sound System.
    ESD  - Use the Enlightenment Sound Daemon.
    
If you need to use one of the alternative systems and want to avoid 
having to run from a terminal everytime, add the switch and the sound
system required to the df script. 



-------------------
  Known   Issues
-------------------

* If the mouse cursor is enabled, and you are running fullscreen
  it reacts strangely around the leftmost and topmost edges of the screen.
* Recorded movies will flicker every few frames, with artifacts on
  larger screen sizes.
* If the lock keys (caps lock, num lock, etc) do not work for you, open
  the df file in a text editor and remove the line that reads
  
  export SDL_DISABLE_LOCK_KEYS=1
  
  it's a work around for a bug in the SDL package in Debian based distributions,
  that reverses the behaviour of the above environmental variable.
